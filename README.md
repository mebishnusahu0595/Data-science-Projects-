# Data-science-projects-
These are the project that I've made for internship.

# There are three projects:- 
  # Project 1 : Predicting Customer Behaviour. 
  Employed KNN algorithm to forecast customer behavior. Leveraged Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. Developed predictive models and generated insightful graphical representations to understand customer trends and preferences.

  # Project 2 : Student Data analysis. 
  Conducted in-depth analysis of student performance based on various factors. Utilized Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore relationships between student outcomes and parental background (education, marital status). Uncovered key insights through data visualization and statistical analysis.

  # Project 3 : Hotel Data Dashboard 
  Built interactive dashboards using Power BI and Power Query. Effectively visualized hotel data to derive actionable business intelligence. Demonstrated proficiency in data modeling, transformation, and presentation for informed decision-making.
